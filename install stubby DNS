Command-line instructions
1.) Install the required packages:

opkg update
opkg install stubby
2.) Enable DNS encryption:

service dnsmasq stop
uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].noresolv="1"
uci -q delete dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].server
uci -q get stubby.global.listen_address \
| sed -e "s/\s/\n/g;s/@/#/g" \
| while read -r STUBBY_SERV
do uci add_list dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].server="${STUBBY_SERV}"
done
3.) Disable local use of dnsmasq/stubby: It is not possible for Stubby to be UP during boot or just right after boot, without additional configuration, because of the race condition with SYSNTPd service. race_conditions_with_sysntpd

uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].localuse="0"
4.) Commit changes:

uci commit dhcp
service dnsmasq start
LAN clients should use Dnsmasq as a primary resolver. Dnsmasq forwards DNS queries to Stubby which encrypts DNS traffic.

Verify domain name resolution with nslookup:

nslookup openwrt.org localhost
